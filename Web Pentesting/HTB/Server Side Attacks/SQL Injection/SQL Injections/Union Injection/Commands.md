## Detect Number of Columns


### Using ORDER BY

- `ORDER BY` is to arrange the data in the table in ascending or descending order. By default its always ascending order.
- The `1` specifies column1, `2` would be column2, `3` for column3....so on. The idea is to continue doing this until we get an error which would indicate the total number of columns in the table. So for example we get an error at `order by 1,2,3,4` so it means we have 3 columns.


```mysql
' ORDER by 1-- '
```

### Using UNION

- It works opposite to `ORDER BY`. We need to keep doing it until we get a success message. **So total number of columns = column number error NOT SHOWN - 1**.
- So if the below payload doesn't produce error it means we have 3 columns.
- The extra `-` after `--` is to specify a space.

```mysql
UNION SELECT 1,2,3,4-- -
```




## Locating the Injection Place

- After SQL injection is possible or not checked.
- After finding number of columns checked.
- Now its time to find the location where the payload should be injected.
- The database might not display some columns but they do exist and the places where the columns are displayed is where we need to paste our payload.
