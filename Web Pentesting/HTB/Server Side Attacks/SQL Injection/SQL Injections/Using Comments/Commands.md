## Bypass Authentication


### Comments Injection

- Imagine a scenario where there are multiple AND, OR statements but you have info on only one of them so we can use `-- '` payload here to eliminate the rest of the conditions by injecting comments and since comments aren't executable so we are able to bypass authentication.
- Comments(`--`) require a space to register.
- Everything in the below query after `admin` will be treated as comment. The below query is just a demo, the query will vary probably in different scenarios.

```mysql
SELECT * FROM <table_name> WHERE <col1_name>='admin'-- ' AND password = 'something';
```
