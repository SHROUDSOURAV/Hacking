### Union Clause

- Used to combine the results of multiple queries. If results of these queries are equal, only one will be shown eliminating duplicates in the display. The results of multiple queries are combined into a single result.
- **UNION** statement can only operate on **SELECT** statements with equal number of columns. If we use **UNION** on two queries having different columns, then we get the following error message.

```mysql
SELECT * FROM <table1_name> UNION SELECT * FROM <tabel2_name>;
```
