### Union Clause

- Used to combine the results of multiple queries. The columns on the tables over which the query is made needs to be equal.
- **UNION** statement can only operate on **SELECT** statements with equal number of columns. If we use **UNION** on two queries having different columns, then we get the following error message.

```mysql
SELECT * FROM <table1_name> UNION SELECT * FROM <tabel2_name>;
```
