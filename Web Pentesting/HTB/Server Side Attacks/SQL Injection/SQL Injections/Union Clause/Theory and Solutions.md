## Union Clause

- Used to combine the results of multiple queries. If results of these queries are equal, only one will be shown eliminating duplicates in the display. The results of multiple queries are combined into a single result.
- **UNION** statement can only operate on **SELECT** statements with equal number of columns. If we use **UNION** on two queries having different columns, then we get the following error message.

```mysql
ERROR 1222 (21000): The used SELECT statements have a different number of columns
```



## Un-Even Columns

- We cannot use **UNION** on queries with different column numbers so to make it even we use string **junk**.
- We also need to make sure the **junk** data has the same datatype as the column we associating it with during the query.

	- **663**


**Database => employees**, **tables => employees, departments**.

```mysql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS Total_Records FROM(SELECT * FROM departments UNION SELECT emp_no, gender FROM employees)AS Combined_Tables;
```
