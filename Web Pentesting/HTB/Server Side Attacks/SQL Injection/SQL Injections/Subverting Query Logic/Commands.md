## SQL Injection Discovery

- Below are some payloads which can be used to discover SQL Injection Vulnerability(SQLi).
- Note: In some cases, we may have to use the URL encoded version of the payload. An example of this is when we put our payload directly in the URL 'i.e. HTTP GET request'.

| Payload | URL Encoded |
| ------- | ----------- |
| `'`     | `%27`       |
| `"`     | `%22`       |
| `#`     | `%23`       |
| `;`     | `%3B`       |
| `)`     | `%29`       |

### OR Injection

- Returns **true** if any condition is **true**.
- Returns **false** if all conditions is **false**.
- `1=1` will always return true and since we use `OR` so if one condition will return false, `1=1` will always return true and we will get the entire table structure.

```sql
'1'='1
```
