- When users supply information to the application so that the application can process the request and make the corresponding query to the database, malicious users can trick the query the database into being used for something that it was not intended by programmer, providing the user access to query the database using an attack known as SQL injection.
- SQL injection refers to attacks against relational databases.
- SQL injection is the attack where the user can interfere with the queries the application makes to the database. This can let the user see or retrieve data they should not have access to.


## SQL Injection DEMO

An SQL injection occurs when user-input is inputted into the SQL query string without properly sanitizing or filtering the input. The previous example showed how user-input can be used within an SQL query, and it did not use any form of input sanitization:

Code: php

```php
$searchInput =  $_POST['findUser'];
$query = "select * from logins where username like '%$searchInput'";
$result = $conn->query($query);
```

In typical cases, the `searchInput` would be inputted to complete the query, returning the expected outcome. Any input we type goes into the following SQL query:

Code: sql

```sql
select * from logins where username like '%$searchInput'
```

So, if we input `admin`, it becomes `'%admin'`. In this case, if we write any SQL code, it would just be considered as a search term. For example, if we input `SHOW DATABASES;`, it would be executed as `'%SHOW DATABASES;'` The web application will search for usernames similar to `SHOW DATABASES;`. However, as there is no sanitization, in this case, **we can add a single quote (`'`), which will end the user-input field, and after it, we can write actual SQL code**. For example, if we search for `1'; DROP TABLE users;`, the search input would be:

Code: php

```php
'%1'; DROP TABLE users;'
```

Notice how we added a single quote (') after "1", in order to escape the bounds of the user-input in ('%$searchInput').

So, the final SQL query executed would be as follows:

Code: sql

```sql
select * from logins where username like '%1'; DROP TABLE users;'
```

As we can see from the syntax highlighting, we can escape the original query's bounds and have our newly injected query execute as well. `Once the query is run, the` users `table will get deleted.`
