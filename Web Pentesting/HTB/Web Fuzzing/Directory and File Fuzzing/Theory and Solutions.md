## Importance of Directory and File Fuzzing
### Uncovering Hidden Assets

- Sensitive Data -> backup files, configuration files, or logs containing user credentials .etc.
- Outdated content -> Older versions of files or scripts that may have potential vulnerabilities or known exploits.
- Development resources -> Testing environments or administrative panels that can be leveraged for further attacks.
- Hidden Functionalities -> Undocumented features or endpoints that could expose to unexpected vulnerabilities.

### Wordlists to use

### Seclists

The below wordlists are part of the `seclists`. In Kali Linux download them using the command. `sudo apt install seclists`.

- `Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt`
- `Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt`
- `Discovery/Web-Content/raft-large-directories.txt`
- `Discovery/Web-Content/big.txt`

## Questions and Solutions

- Within the "webfuzzing_hidden_path" path on the target system (ie http://IP:PORT/webfuzzing_hidden_path/), fuzz for folders and then files to find the flag.


First as mentioned in the question we need to perform directory fuzzing. Below is the command for directory fuzzing performed using `ffuf`.

```bash
ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/big.txt -u http://94.237.61.202:45294/webfuzzing_hidden_path/FUZZ
```

We will get our directory through the above directory fuzzing technique and after that perform File Fuzzing using `ffuf`. Below is the command.

```bash
ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/big.txt -u http://94.237.61.202:45294/webfuzzing_hidden_path/flag/FUZZ -e .php,.html,.txt,.bak,.js -v
```

I got a hit after applying the above command and then I used `curl` to print the contents of the webpage. Below is the demonstration of it.

```bash
curl http://94.237.61.202:45294/webfuzzing_hidden_path/flag/flag.html
```

You will get the flag in the HTML code.
