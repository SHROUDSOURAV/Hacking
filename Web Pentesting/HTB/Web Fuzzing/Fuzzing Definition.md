## Fuzzing

- It is a broader term than Bruteforcing.
- Automated software testing technique.
- Generating random values, patterns and other datatypes and feeding these data on the target application and seeing how the application reacts.
- This data or payload is applied and the response given the application is analyzed to get a understanding of the application's architecture and workflow.
- The data can itself be invalid or unexpected but whether the target application crashes or not or does something else is carefully analyzed for getting an idea for exploitation.
- Below are some of reasons why fuzzing is done :-
	- Uncovering Hidden Vulnerabilities
		
	- Automating Security Testing
		
	- Strengthening Input Validation (for preventing SQL injections or cross-site-scripting (XSS) )
		
	- Improving Code Quality 

## Bruteforcing

- Its more of a targeted approach than Fuzzing.
- Multiple combinations or possibilities of a specific value is tested against the target machine.
