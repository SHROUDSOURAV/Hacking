| `-s` (include)     | Include only responses with the specified status codes (comma-separated).           | You're looking for redirects, so you filter for codes `301,302,307`                    |
| `-b` (exclude)     | Exclude responses with the specified status codes (comma-separated).                | The server returns many 404 errors. Exclude them with `-b 404`                         |
| `--exclude-length` | Exclude responses with specific content lengths (comma-separated, supports ranges). | You're not interested in 0-byte or 404-byte responses, so use `--exclude-length 0,404` |

```bash
# only show status codes 200, 301, and 302 
# exclude response lengths being 0
gobuster dir -u http://<URL>:<PORT> -w <wordlist.txt> -s 200,301,302 --exclude-length 0

| `-mc` (match code)                             | Include only responses that match the specified status codes. You can provide a single code, multiple codes separated by commas, or ranges of codes separated by hyphens (e.g., `200,204,301`, `400-499`). The default behavior is to match codes 200-299, 301, 302, 307, 401, 403, 405, and 500. | After fuzzing, you notice many 302 (Found) redirects, but you're primarily interested in 200 (OK) responses. Use `-mc 200` to isolate these. |
| `-fc` (filter code)                            | Exclude responses that match the specified status codes, using the same format as `-mc`. This is useful for removing common error codes like 404 Not Found.                                                                                                                                       | A scan returns many 404 errors. Use `-fc 404` to remove them from the output.                                                                |
| `-fs` (filter size)                            | Exclude responses with a specific size or range of sizes. You can specify single sizes or ranges using hyphens (e.g., `-fs 0` for empty responses, `-fs 100-200` for responses between 100 and 200 bytes).                                                                                        | You suspect the interesting responses will be larger than 1KB. Use `-fs 0-1023` to filter out smaller responses.                             |
| `-ms` (match size)                             | Include only responses that match a specific size or range of sizes, using the same format as `-fs`.                                                                                                                                                                                              | You are looking for a backup file that you know is exactly 3456 bytes in size. Use `-ms 3456` to find it.                                    |
| `-fw` (filter out number of words in response) | Exclude responses containing the specified number of words in the response.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | You're filtering out a specific number of words from the responses. Use `-fw 219` to filter for responses containing that amount of words.   |
| `-mw` (match word count)                       | Include only responses that have the specified amount of words in the response body.                                                                                                                                                                                                              | You're looking for short, specific error messages. Use `-mw 5-10` to filter for responses with 5 to 10 words.                                |
| `-fl` (filter line)                            | Exclude responses with a specific number of lines or range of lines. For example, `-fl 5` will filter out responses with 5 lines.                                                                                                                                                                 | You notice a pattern of 10-line error messages. Use `-fl 10` to filter them out.                                                             |
| `-ml` (match line count)                       | Include only responses that have the specified amount of lines in the response body.                                                                                                                                                                                                              | You're looking for responses with a specific format, such as 20 lines. Use `-ml 20` to isolate them.                                         |
| `-mt` (match time)                             | Include only responses that meet a specific time-to-first-byte (TTFB) condition. This is useful for identifying responses that are unusually slow or fast, potentially indicating interesting behavior.                                                                                           | The application responds slowly when processing certain inputs. Use `-mt >500` to find responses with a TTFB greater than 500 milliseconds.  |

```bash
# Find directories with status code 200, based on the amount of words, and a response size greater than 500 bytes
ffuf -u http://<IP>:<PORT>/FUZZ -w <wordlist.txt> -mc 200 -fw 427 -ms >500

# Filter out responses with status codes 404, 401, and 302
ffuf -u http://<IP>:<PORT>/FUZZ -w <wordlist.txt> -fc 404,401,302

# Find backup files with the .bak extension and size between 10KB and 100KB
ffuf -u http://<IP>:<PORT>/FUZZ.bak -w <wordlist.txt> -fs 0-10239 -ms 10240-102400

# Discover endpoints that take longer than 500ms to respond
ffuf -u http://<IP>:<PORT>/FUZZ -w <wordlist.txt> -mt >500
```

| `--sl` (show length)       | Include only responses with the specified content length (in lines).                                       | You suspect a specific response with a known line count is related to a vulnerability. Use `--sl` to pinpoint it.                                          |
| `--hw` (hide word)         | Exclude responses with the specified number of words.                                                      | The server includes common phrases in many responses. Use `--hw` to filter out responses with those word counts.                                           |
| `--sw` (show word)         | Include only responses with the specified number of words.                                                 | You are looking for short error messages. Use `--sw` with a low value to find them.                                                                        |
| `--hs` (hide size)         | Exclude responses with the specified response size (in bytes or characters).                               | The server sends large files for valid requests. Use `--hs` to filter out these large responses and focus on smaller ones.                                 |
| `--ss` (show size)         | Include only responses with the specified response size (in bytes or characters).                          | You are looking for a specific file size. Use `--ss` to find it.                                                                                           |
| `--hr` (hide regex)        | Exclude responses whose body matches the specified regular expression.                                     | Filter out responses containing the "Internal Server Error" message. Use `--hr "Internal Server Error"`.                                                   |
| `--sr` (show regex)        | Include only responses whose body matches the specified regular expression.                                | Filter for responses containing the string "admin" using `--sr "admin"`.                                                                                   |
| `--filter`/`--hard-filter` | General-purpose filter to show/hide responses or prevent their post-processing using a regular expression. | `--filter "Login"` will show only responses containing "Login", while `--hard-filter "Login"` will hide them and prevent any plugins from processing them. |

```bash
# Show only successful requests and redirects:
wenum -w <wordlist.txt> --sc 200,301,302 -u https://<IP>:<PORT>/FUZZ

# Hide responses with common error codes:
