## Web Proxies

- Specialized tools setup between a browser/mobile application and a backend server.
- Used to capture and view all the web requests sent between both backend and browser/mobile application.
- Acts as a man-in-the-middle(MITM) tool.
- Web Proxies can be used to capture HTTP requests and replay them.
- Web Proxies work in the application layer unlike Wireshark which works in low-level for Network Sniffing and packet analysis.

### Other uses of Web Proxies

- Web crawling
- Web application mapping
- Web request analysis
- Web configuration testing
- Code reviews
