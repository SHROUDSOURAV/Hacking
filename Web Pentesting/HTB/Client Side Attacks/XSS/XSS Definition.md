## Cross-Site-Scripting (XSS)

- Client side vulnerability.
- Happens when no proper input validation is done so if the user/client performs a certain attack then that malicious code gets executed in the client side without the client's knowledge.
- Backend servers are not that affected by this vulnerability(XSS).

## Cross-Site-Scripting(XSS) Attacks

- A basic example of XSS attack can be having the target user unwillingly send their cookie to the attacker's web server.
- Another example can be making the target user's browser make API calls which lead to changing of the user's password to the attacker's choice.
