## Reflected XSS

- Non Persistent XSS i.e. vulnerability is temporary and it doesn't persist through page refreshes.
- Reflected XSS gets processed by the backend server.
- Only affects the targeted user and will not affect any other user visiting the page.
- Occurs when input reaches backend server and gets returned to us without being filtered or sanitized. If we move from one page to another, Reflected XSS payloads will not work since they are not persistent.
