## DOM Attacks

The `innerHTML` does not allow `<script>` tag because of security issues so we need to use a different approach for DOM XSS exploitation.

```html
<img src="" onerror=alert(document.cookie)>
```

Here basically if the `<img>` tag fails to load the external file, then `<onerror>` tag will execute the JavaScript code present within `""`.  The above payload shows the **cookie** value.
