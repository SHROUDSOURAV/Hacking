## DOM Attacks

DOM XSS does not allow `<script>` tag because of security issues so there are other ways to inject XSS payloads. Below are some examples


```html
<img src="" onerror="alert(document.cookie)">
```

Here basically if the `<img>` tag fails to load the external file, then `<onerror>` tag will execute the JavaScript code present within `""`.
