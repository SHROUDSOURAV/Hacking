## DOM XSS

- Non Persistent XSS
- DOM XSS input data gets completely processed by the client side through JavaScript. Our input data never reaches the backend server for processing.
- Occurs when JavaScript is used to change page source through the Document Object Model (DOM).
- Non Persistent XSS so moving to a new page will remove the payload or effect.

### Source and Sink

- **Source** is the JavaScript object that takes the user input, it can be a URL parameter or any input field .etc.
- **Sink** is the function that writes the input data into the DOM Object on the webpage without sanitizing the input data.


## Commonly used DOM objects

- `document.write()`
- `DOM.innerHTML`
- `DOM.outerHTML`
