## XSS Payloads

- `origin` is read only property.
- Returns the protocol, hostname/IP address and port number of the URL in a string format.
- The `alert` will display the information in a box of the webpage.

```html
<script>alert(window.origin)</script>
```


### Other XSS Payloads

- `alert(<message>)` --> a string you want to display in the alert dialog, or, alternatively, an object that is converted into a string and displayed.
	 
- `<plaintext>` --> will stop rendering the HTML code that comes after it and display it as plaintext. (**DEPRECATED**) but may still support in many web browsers.
	 
- `window.print()` --> opens the web browser's print dialog box that allows the user to print the current webpage content.
	
- `document.cookie` --> can be used to read, write, or delete cookies.
	- **READ COOKIE** 

```js
let printCookie = document.cookie;
console.log(printCookie);
```
