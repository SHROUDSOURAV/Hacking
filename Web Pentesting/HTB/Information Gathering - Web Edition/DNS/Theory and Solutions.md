## DNS

- Domain Name Server (DNS)
- Helps to translate Domain Name to IP Address.

### How DNS works

- **DNS query** : When the domain name is entered the computer first checks its memory(cache) to see if it remembers it. If it doesn't remember it reaches the DNS resolver, usually provided by the Internet Service Provider(ISP).
	|
- **Recursive lookup** : The Resolver also has a cache, if it doesn't find the IP there then it starts journey to the DNS hierarchy.
	
- **Root Server** : The root server doesn't know the exact address but able to find out the Top Level Domain(TLD) (eg: .com, .edu).
	 
- **Authoritative Name Server** : The authoritative name server is the final stop as it has the exact IP address of the requested domain. It sends it back to the resolver.
	
- **Connection** : Our DNS resolver brings back the IP address and our computer caches it, incase we visit the website again soon. Now that our computer knows the IP address of the domain, we are able to directly connect to the web server hosting the website.  


### Types of DNS records

| Record Type | Description                                                           |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A           | Maps a hostname to an IPv4 address.                                   |
| AAAA        | Maps a hostname to an IPv6 address.                                   |
| CNAME       | Creates an alias for a hostname, pointing it to another hostname.     |
| MX          | Specifies mail servers responsible for handling email for the domain. |
| NS          | Delegates a DNS zone to a specific authoritative name server.         |
| TXT         | Stores arbitrary text information.                                    |
| SOA         | Contains administrative information about a DNS zone.                 |

## The Hosts file

- A simple text file.
- Contains mapping of hostnames(a human readable name) with their corresponding IP addresses.
- Used for testing, development purposes to add hostnames, ip addresses not present in public.
- Used for manual DNS resolution.
- To edit hosts file you need `root` privileges.

## Why DNS Matters for Web Recon

- Can reveal subdomains, mail servers, name server records.
- Can help reveal Network Infrastructure and understand traffic flow and other endpoints.
- Can reveal other types of DNS records.
